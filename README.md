This project is a browser-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in JavaScript. It uses `localStorage` to store the number of rounds and player names, allowing the game to persist essential settings across sessions. The game features a turn-based system that alternates between two players (X and O), automatically updates the turn display, and dynamically renders the game board. It checks for winning conditions after each move, updates player scores accordingly, and supports multiple rounds without resetting the overall score. The game also detects draw situations and provides a clear board function that resets the current round while preserving the ongoing match score.
